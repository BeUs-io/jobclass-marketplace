## 🔧 Build Commands

### Development Build
```bash
npm run build -- --configuration development
```

### Production Build (Optimized)
```bash
npm run build
# or
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run build
```

### Build with Statistics
```bash
npm run build -- --stats-json
```

### Serve Production Build Locally
```bash
# Install http-server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Serve the build
cd dist/jobclass-angular/browser
http-server -p 8080
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

## 📝 Environment Configuration

### For Different Environments
1. Create environment files:
   - `src/environments/environment.ts` (development)
   - `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` (production)

2. Add your API endpoints and configuration:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'https://api.yoursite.com',
  // other config
};
```

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [x] Build successful
- [x] All routes working
- [x] Assets loading correctly
- [x] No console errors
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] API endpoints updated
- [ ] Analytics configured (optional)
- [ ] SEO meta tags added (optional)

## 🔍 Verification

After deployment, verify:
1. Homepage loads correctly
2. Navigation works
3. All features accessible:
   - `/companies` - Companies directory
   - `/companies/compare` - Company comparison tool
   - `/jobs` - Job listings
   - `/messages` - Messaging system

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with Memory Error
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run build

### Assets Not Loading
Check that the base href is correct in `index.html`:
```html
<base href="/">
```
